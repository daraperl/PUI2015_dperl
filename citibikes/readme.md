Team Members: Dara Perl, Diogo Miura, Nate Weber, Keith Dumanski, and Neil Verosh

In this assignment, we looked at the idea that the start time of a ride is dependent on the age of the rider.  
We were able to narrow the scope into a null hypothesis that age group (millennial and non millennial) 
and late night riding (10PM and 3AM) are independent.   We used the chi-squared test to prove this. 
To go about this assignment, each member of the group spent two days completing their own code after our 
initial meeting to discuss the main idea, before we met again to complete our code.  
At this point we reviewed the individual code fragments and chose two codes to work with separately so that 
if one group ran into issues the other might have the solution.  The two codes that were used were Nate Weber’s and Dara Perl’s. 
Nate, Diogo and Keith worked on one code and Dara and Neil worked on the second.  (Unfortunately beyond that I cannot speak to 
Nate, Diogo and Keith’s process except for the few times they were able to help Neil and I with our code).  
Nate introduced the query function to us and helped us work through querying the data.  
Diogo helped us adjust our hypothesis to better fit the chi-squared test.  
Neil worked on the statistics portion so I could code it and also explained many of the concepts behind why certain 
portions of the chi squared test were performed a certain way.  I was in charge of most of the coding on this piece of 
code, as well as figuring out why our chi square statistic was negative (we had reached the maximum size of the number).  
When we compared the final codes this code was completed and chosen.  As a group we chose to keep coding and comparing to 
have our best version of the code.

Required Data: January 2015 Citibike Data
In this file I used the January 2015 Citibike Data and the KS, Pearson and Spearman Tests to test the goodness of fit of male and female and day and night riders.
