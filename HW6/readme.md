Contributors: Dara Perl and Maria Ortiz

This assignment uses data from the MTA regarding the types of metrocard swipes and station usages.   In the assignment, part one looks at event detection and the most prominent event is Hurricaine Sandy, the second part of the assignment looks at the usage of each type of metrocard type and the last part looks at the periodicity of each station with a 1 year (52 week) period. 
For the assignment, Maria and I worked together on understanding the assignment and reviewing our results.  Maria helped me to remember to visualize the data as well as contributed heavily to the plotting.  I contributed much of the looping code and some of the code break down (how to break down the problem into code-able pieces).
