In this file I used the synthetic data for the poisson and binomial distributions and compared them to the Normal Distribution using the KS, KL and Anderson Darling Tests to test the goodness of fit. Output includes the test statistics as well as graphs for increasing n (binomial) and lambda (poisson) of the test statistics. For this Assignment Michelle Ho and I reviewed the statistics together in order to ensure understanding of the tests.
