In this file, the Chi Squared, Normal, Poisson, Binomial, Laplace, and Logistic distributions are used to plot a randomly 
generated sample size against the sample mean for 100 points.  The population mean was set to 100 for all distributions.  
Additionally, the sample mean was plotted as a histogram. This histogram centers around the population mean as expected. 
This Assignment takes no arguments (input variables) and has no global set ups

In this file we reproduced the research from post prison employment research.  This work was done using the binomial distribution and the chi-squared distribution.  As a group, we reviewed the statistics involved and discussed the findings, however each person made their own ipython notebook and completed their own work.
