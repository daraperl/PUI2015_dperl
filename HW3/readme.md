In this file, the Chi Squared, Normal, Poisson, Binomial, Laplace, and Logistic distributions are used to plot a randomly 
generated sample size against the sample mean for 100 points.  The population mean was set to 100 for all distributions.  
Additionally, the sample mean was plotted as a histogram. This histogram centers around the population mean as expected. 
This Assignment takes no arguments (input variables) and has no global set ups
