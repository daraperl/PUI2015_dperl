Plot Review Comments:
The plot included above from cindyliu686 does not include a legend or a title, which makes it tough to tell what the graph and the colored points are showing.  Additionally, in the blue section of points, it is tough to tell what is happening because the points are all very clustered and it appears the opacity has been changed for each individual point. The plot included here also includes both red and green colors for points which may be very tough for color blind people to view as different.

Plot Review Comments:
The plot included above from fanshi118 uses 3D plotting which makes it almost impossible to read.  I would have suggested using a 2D plot with the third variable as a color. The points are also very large which makes it difficult to review any one plot.  In some areas I can see a line which connects the points, but I cannot tell what where it goes or what its point is.  It appears to just add busy-ness to the plot. Finally the axes titles run into the plot labels making it difficult to read and the abbreviation of "reg." is unclear.

Plot Review Comments:
I actually quite like this graph.  You can easily tell that each of the color points is a team in the NBA and that the number of minutes played is being graphed against the number of points.  I would have liked to see if there was a correlation per team or on the whole of the number of minutes and the number of points scored.  Additionally, this graph would be hard to be read by a color blind person (both red and green are used here) and the kelly colors could have helped with that.
