#Assignment 1 
Group Mates: Maria Fillipelli
The code for this assignment does linear regression on the log of the data for square footage of buildings and the energy
usage as reported to LL84.  Linear regression is done with a 1 degree polynomial and a 2 degree polynomial. 
For this Assignment Maria and I did the first half by ourselves and worked on the linear regressions and analyses together.  
We reviewed the statistics involved in the likelihood test and how to use the degrees of freedom for this test.
