#Assignment 1 
Group Mates: Maria Fillipelli

The code for this assignment does linear regression on the log of the data for square footage of buildings and the energy
usage as reported to LL84.  Linear regression is done with a 1 degree polynomial and a 2 degree polynomial. 
For this Assignment Maria and I did the first half by ourselves and worked on the linear regressions and analyses together.  
We reviewed the statistics involved in the likelihood test and how to use the degrees of freedom for this test. 

#Assignment 2
Group Mates: Maria Fillipelli, Nate Weber

The code for this investigates the gender wage gap.  Gender wage gap is reviewed by race as well as overall gap.  
For this AssignmentI worked on the first half with Maria.  We worked together on reviewing the data and grouping it by Race.  Nate and I worked on the final plots with all of the data together. We worked on the code separately, but reviewed our results together.
