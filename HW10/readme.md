For this assignment, I worked with census data for the number of establishments in NYC.  I used a KMeans Cluster from scipy and SKLearn and the DBSCAN clustering methods on the data.  The data was plotted as a time series and as a map.  
I worked with Diogo and Maria for importing the data.  Diogo helped me to make my import more pythonic from my initial imports. 
I worked with Nate to plot with K Means and to plot on the maps.  
I worked with Michelle for DBSCAN and understanding the function. 
I contributed to the DBSCAN and pythonization of the plotting methods. I worked to make kmeans from scipy work to produce our first clustering values. Additionally, I worked on standardizing and cleaning the data on my own.
